<h2><a name="About This Reference"></a>About This Reference</h2>
<p   >This reference describes the OpenDJ configuration properties that can be manipulated with the dsconfig command.</p>
<p   >Configuration components are grouped according to the area of the server in which they are used, as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Core Server</li>
<li>Database</li>
<li>Logging</li>
<li>Replication</li>
<li>Security</li>
<li>User Management</li>
</ul>
<p   >For ease of reference, the configuration is described on multiple tabs. These tabs provide alternative views of the configuration components:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>Inheritance</strong> view represents the inheritance relationships between configuration components. A sub-component inherits all of the properties of its parent component.</li>
<li>The <strong>Structure</strong> view represents the structural relationships between components and indicates how certain components can exist only within container components. When a container component is deleted, all of the components within it are also deleted.</li>
<li>The <strong>Components</strong> view provides an alphabetical list of all configuration components.</li>
<li>The <strong>Properties</strong> view provides an alphabetical list of all configuration properties, and indicates the configuration component to which each property applies.</li>
</ul>
<br>
<p   >When you set up OpenDJ, certain components are created in the configuration by default. These components are configured with specific values, which are not necessarily the same as the "default values" of new components that you create using dsconfig. The "default values" listed in this document refer to the values of the new components that you create using dsconfig.</p>
