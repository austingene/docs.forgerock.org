  This chapter explains how OpenIG acts
  as an OAuth 2.0 client or OpenID Connect 1.0 relying party,
  and follows with a tutorial
  that shows you how to use OpenIG
  as an OpenID Connect 1.0 relying party.

   As described in the chapter,
   <a href="../../gateway-guide/index/chap-oauth2-rs.html" class="link"><em class="citetitle">OpenIG as an OAuth 2.0 Resource Server</em></a>,
   an OAuth 2.0 client is the third-party application that needs access
   to a user's protected resources.
   The client application therefore has the user (the OAuth 2.0 resource owner)
   delegate authorization by authenticating
   with an identity provider (the OAuth 2.0 authorization server)
   using an existing account,
   and then consenting to authorize access to protected resources
   (on an OAuth 2.0 resource server).
  </p><p>
   OpenIG can act as an OAuth 2.0 client when you configure an
   <a href="../../reference/index/OAuth2ClientFilter.html" class="link">OAuth2ClientFilter</a>.
   The filter handles the process of allowing the user to select a provider,
   and redirecting the user through the authentication and authorization steps
   of an OAuth 2.0 authorization code grant,
   which results in the authorization server returning an access token to the filter.
   At the outcome of a successful authorization grant,
   the filter injects the access token data
   into a configurable target field of the exchange
   so that subsequent filters and handlers have access
   to the access token.
   Subsequent requests can use the access token without re-authentication.
  </p><p>
   If the protected application is an OAuth 2.0 resource server,
   then OpenIG can send the access token with the resource request.
  </p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="about-oidc-rp"></a>8.2.&nbsp;About OpenIG as an OpenID Connect 1.0 Relying Party</h2></div></div></div><p>
   The specifications available through the
   <a class="link" href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749" target="_blank">OpenID Connect</a> site describe an authentication layer built on OAuth 2.0,
   which is OpenID Connect 1.0.
  </p><p>
   OpenID Connect 1.0 is a specific implementation of OAuth 2.0
   where the identity provider holds the protected resource
   that the third-party application aims to access.
   This resource is the <em class="firstterm">UserInfo</em>,
   information about the authenticated end-user expressed in a standard format.
  </p><div class="itemizedlist"><p>
    In OpenID Connect 1.0, the key entities are the following.
   </p><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>
     The <em class="firstterm">end user</em> (OAuth 2.0 resource owner)
     whose user information the application needs to access.
    </p><p>
     The end user wants to use an application
     through existing identity provider account
     without signing up to and creating credentials for yet another web service.
    </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
     The <em class="firstterm">Relying Party</em> (RP) (OAuth 2.0 client)
     needs access to the end user's protected user information.
    </p><p>
     For example, an online mail application needs to know which end user
     is accessing the application in order to present the correct inbox.
    </p><p>
     As another example, an online shopping site needs to know which end user
     is accessing the site in order to present
     the right offerings, account, and shopping cart.
    </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
     The <em class="firstterm">OpenID Provider</em> (OP)
     (OAuth 2.0 authorization server and also resource server)
     that holds the user information and grants access.
    </p><p>
     The OP effectively has the end user consent to providing the RP
     with access to some of its user information.
     As OpenID Connect 1.0 defines unique identification for an account
     (subject identifier + issuer identifier),
     the RP can use this as a key to its own user profile.
    </p><p>
     In the case of the online mail application,
     this key could be used to access the mailboxes and related account information.
     In the case of the online shopping site,
     this key could be used to access the offerings, account, shopping cart and so forth.
     The key makes it possible to serve users as if they had local accounts.
    </p></li></ul></div><p>
   When OpenIG acts therefore as an OpenID Connect 1.0 relying party,
   its ultimate role is to retrieve user information from the OpenID provider,
   and then to inject that information into the exchange
   for use by subsequent filters and handlers.
  </p><p>
   In the tutorial that follows,
   you configure OpenIG as a relying party,
   and use OpenAM as the OpenID Provider.
  </p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="oidc-rp-tutorial-before-you-start"></a>8.3.&nbsp;Preparing the Tutorial</h2></div></div></div><p>
   In the chapter on
   <a href="../../gateway-guide/index/chap-quickstart.html" class="link"><em class="citetitle">Getting Started</em></a>,
   you learned how to configure OpenIG
   to proxy traffic and capture request and response data.
   You also learned how to configure OpenIG
   to use a static request to log in with hard-coded credentials.
  </p><p>
   This tutorial shows you how OpenIG
   can act as an OpenID Connect 1.0 relying party.
  </p><p>
   This tutorial relies on OpenAM as an OpenID Provider.
   As a relying party, OpenIG takes the end user to OpenAM
   for authorization and an access token.
   It then uses the access token to get end user information from OpenAM.
  </p><p>
   Before you start this tutorial,
   prepare OpenIG and the minimal HTTP server as you did for the chapter on
   <a href="../../gateway-guide/index/chap-quickstart.html" class="link"><em class="citetitle">Getting Started</em></a>.
  </p><p>
   OpenIG should be running in Jetty,
   configured to access the minimal HTTP server as described in that chapter.
  </p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="oidc-rp-tutorial-openam-config"></a>8.4.&nbsp;Setting Up OpenAM as an OpenID Provider</h2></div></div></div><p>
   Install and configure OpenAM on
   <code class="literal">http://openam.example.com:8088/openam</code>
   with the default configuration.
   If you use a different configuration,
   make sure you substitute in the tutorial accordingly.
   Although this tutorial does not use HTTPS,
   you must use HTTPS to protect access tokens and user information
   in production environments.
  </p><p>
   Login to the OpenAM console as administrator,
   and use the common task wizard, Configure OAuth2,
   to configure an OAuth 2.0 authorization server in / (Top Level Realm).
   This also configures OpenAM as an OpenID Provider.
  </p><p>
   Also create an OAuth 2.0 Client profile in / (Top Level Realm).
   This allows OpenIG to communicate with OpenAM as an OAuth 2.0 client.
   In OpenAM console, browse to
   Access Control &gt; / (Top Level Realm) &gt; Agents &gt; OAuth 2.0 Client,
   and then click New in the Agent table.
  </p><p>
   Create an OAuth 2.0 client profile with name <code class="literal">OpenIG</code>
   and password <code class="literal">password</code>.
   The name is the "clientId" value, and the password is the "clientSecret" value
   that you use in the provider configuration in OpenIG.
  </p><p>
   Edit the <code class="literal">OpenIG</code> client profile
   to add the Redirection URI
   <code class="literal">http://www.example.com:8080/openid/callback</code>.
   Also add <code class="literal">openid</code> and <code class="literal">profile</code> scopes
   to the Scope(s) list, and then save your work.
  </p><p>
   In this tutorial,
   you overload the profile settings to pass credentials to OpenIG.
   This tutorial uses Full Name and Last Name for the sake of simplicity.
   Both of those attributes are part of a user's profile
   out of the box with the default OpenAM configuration.
   Neither of the attributes are needed for anything else in this tutorial.
   So this tutorial uses Last Name to hold the username,
   and Full Name to hold the password.
   In a real deployment, you would no doubt use other attributes,
   depending upon the user profiles and on your requirements.
  </p><div class="orderedlist"><p>
    To overload the profile,
    create a user whose additional credentials you set in
    the Full Name and Last Name fields,
    or edit the existing user <code class="literal">george</code> if you have already
    created the profile for another tutorial.
   </p><ol class="orderedlist" type="1"><li class="listitem"><p>
     In OpenAM console,
     under Access Control &gt; / (Top Level Realm) &gt; Subjects &gt; User,
     click New to create the user profile.
    </p><p>
     If the profile already exists in the table,
     then click the link to open the profile for editing.
    </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
     Set the ID to <code class="literal">george</code>,
     the password to <code class="literal">costanza</code>,
     the Last Name to <code class="literal">george</code>,
     and the Full Name to <code class="literal">costanza</code>
     before clicking OK (or Save).
    </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
     When finished, log out of OpenAM console by clicking the log out button.
     It is not enough simply to close the browser tab,
     as the OpenAM session remains active until you log out or quit the browser.
    </p></li></ol></div></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="oidc-rp-tutorial-gateway-config"></a>8.5.&nbsp;Configuring OpenIG as a Relying Party</h2></div></div></div><p>

  "baseURI": "http://www.example.com:8080"
}

  </pre></div><p>
   On Windows, the file name should be
   <code class="filename">%appdata%\OpenIG\config\routes\07-openid.json</code>.
  </p><div class="itemizedlist"><p>
    Notice the following features of the new route.
   </p><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>
     At the global level the route changes the base URI for requests
     to ensure that the initial exchange happens
     between OpenIG and OpenAM, which is the OpenID Provider.
     This route sends only the final request to the protected application.
    </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
     The first filter in the outermost chain has the
     <a href="../../reference/index/OAuth2ClientFilter.html" class="link">OAuth2ClientFilter</a> type.
     This is the filter that enables OpenIG to act as a relying party.
    </p><p>
     The filter is configured to work only with a single provider,
     the OpenAM server you configured in
     <a class="xref" href="chap-oauth2-client.html#oidc-rp-tutorial-openam-config" title="8.4.&nbsp;Setting Up OpenAM as an OpenID Provider">Section&nbsp;8.4, &#8220;Setting Up OpenAM as an OpenID Provider&#8221;</a>.
     If you had more than one provider configured,
     you would need a "loginHandler" as well to help end users pick a provider.
    </p><p>
     The "OAuth2ClientFilter" has
     a base client endpoint of <code class="literal">/openid</code>.
     Incoming requests to <code class="literal">/openid/login</code>
     start the delegated authorization process.
     Incoming requests to <code class="literal">/openid/callback</code>
     are expected as redirects from the OP (as authorization server),
     so this is why you set the redirect URI in the client profile in OpenAM to
     <code class="literal">http://www.example.com:8080/openid/callback</code>.
    </p><p>
     The "OAuth2ClientFilter" has <code class="literal">"requireHttps": false</code>
     as a convenience for testing.
     In production environments, require HTTPS.
    </p><p>
     The filter has <code class="literal">"requireLogin": true</code> to ensure you see
     the delegated authorization process when you make your request.
    </p><p>
     In the "OAuth2ClientFilter",
     the target for storing authorization state information is
     <code class="literal">${exchange.openid}</code>,
     so this is where subsequent filters and handlers can find
     access token and user information.
    </p><p>
     The scopes are set to "openid" and "profile"
     as allowed for OpenID Connect 1.0.
    </p><p>
     Notice that on failure the filter
     dumps the current information in the exchange
     into a web page response to the end user.
     While this is helpful to you for debugging purposes,
     it is not helpful to an end user.
     In production environments, return a more user-friendly failure page.
    </p><p>
     Also in the "OAuth2ClientFilter",
     the typical "ClientHandler" configures the HTTP client that communicates
     with the OpenID Provider.
    </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
     After the filter injects the access token and user information
     into <code class="literal">exchange.openid</code>,
     OpenIG invokes a "Chain".
     The "Chain" uses the credentials to log the user in
     to the minimal HTTP server.
    </p><p>
     With this configuration, all successful requests result in login attempts
     against the minimal HTTP server.
    </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
     The "StaticRequestFilter" retrieves
     the username and password from the exchange
     and replaces the original HTTP GET request
     with an HTTP POST login request
     that contains the credentials to authenticate.
    </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
     The route matches requests to <code class="literal">/openid</code>.
    </p></li></ul></div></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="oidc-rp-tutorial-test"></a>8.6.&nbsp;Trying It Out</h2></div></div></div><p>
   To try your configuration, browse to OpenIG at
   <a class="link" href="http://www.example.com:8080/openid" target="_blank">http://www.example.com:8080/openid</a>.
  </p><p>
   When redirected to the OpenAM login page,
   login as user <code class="literal">george</code>, password <code class="literal">costanza</code>,
   and then allow the application access to user information.
  </p><p>
   If successful, OpenIG logs you into the minimal HTTP server
   as George Costanza, and the minimal HTTP server returns George's page.
  </p><p>
   What is happening behind the scenes?
  </p><p>
   After OpenIG gets the browser request,
   the "OAuth2ClientFilter" redirects you to authenticate with OpenAM
   and consent to authorize access to user information.
   After you authorize access, OpenAM returns an access token to the filter.
  </p><p>
   The filter then uses that access token to get the user information.
   The filter injects the authorization state information into
   <code class="literal">exchange.openid</code>.
   The outermost chain then calls its handler, which as another "Chain".
  </p><p>
   This inner chain uses the credentials to log the user in
   to the minimal HTTP server, which responds with its User Information page.
